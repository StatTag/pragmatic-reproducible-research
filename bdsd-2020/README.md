# Biomedical Data Science Day 2020

[Biomedical Data Science Day (BDSD) 2020](https://www.nucats.northwestern.edu/resources/data-science-and-informatics/biomedical-data-science-day.html) was held on February 4, 2020 at the Prentice Women's Hospital in the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine campus in downtown Chicago.

This brief presentation provided attendees with an introduction to the concept of reproducible research, and pragmatic ways in which reproducible research can be conducted.

**Pragmatic Reproducible Research for Data Scientists**

Abstract:

Conducting reproducible research is both an opportunity and a challenge. Research is more efficient and robust when research teams can easily recreate and reproduce findings using original data. However, adopting reproducible research workflows can be daunting due to technical barriers, a perceived need to switch away from a favorite software, or the impression that reproducible research is an “all-or-nothing” endeavor. In this session we will explore how to approach reproducible research: steps for starting small, expanding capability, and both technical and non-technical strategies to help along the way. Through interactive activities, we will engage with participants to consider how reproducible research practices could apply to their own projects. We will discuss source code control, electronic laboratory notebooks, containers and dynamic documents. Given the introductory nature of the session, a high-level survey of concepts (including available tools and software) will be provided. This session will equip participants to assess and implement next steps for incorporating reproducible research practices in their own projects.
